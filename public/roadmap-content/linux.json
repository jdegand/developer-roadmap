Mastering the basic Linux navigation commands such as `cd`, `pwd`, `ls`, and `tree` enables you to flawlessly move from one point to another within the filesystem, display the list of files & directories, and understand your position relative to other system components.\n\nHere is how you use these commands:\n\n*   To change directories, use the `cd` command:\n\n    cd /path/to/directory\n    \n\n*   To list the contents of a directory, use the `ls` command:\n\n    ls\n    \n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

Simply put, command path is a variable that is used by the shell to determine where to look for the executable files to run. Linux commands are nothing but programs residing in particular directories. But, one does not have to navigate to these directories every time to run these programs. The command path comes to the rescue!\n\nUsually, when you type a command in the terminal, the shell needs to know the absolute path of the command's executable to run it. Instead of typing the full path each time, command paths allow the shell to automatically search the indicated directories in the correct order. These paths are stored in the $PATH environment variable.\n\n    echo $PATH\n    \n\nRunning this command in a Linux terminal will return all the directories that the shell will search, in order, to find the command it has to run. The directories are separated by a colon.\n\nThis feature makes using Linux command-line interface convenient and efficient.",

Linux being a multi-user and multi-tasking operating system, every process typically has 3 streams opened:\n\n*   Standard Input (stdin) - This is where the process reads its input from. The default is the keyboard.\n*   Standard Output (stdout) - The process writes its output to stdout. By default, this means the terminal.\n*   Standard Error (stderr) - The process writes error messages to stderr. This also goes to the terminal by default.\n\nRedirection in Linux allows us to manipulate these streams, advancing the flexibility with which commands or programs are run. Besides the default devices (keyboard for input and terminal for output), the I/O streams can be redirected to files or other devices.\n\nFor example, if you want to store the output of a command into a file instead of printing it to the console, we can use the '>' operator.\n\n    ls -al > file_list.txt\n    \n\nThis command will write the output of 'ls -al' into 'file\\_list.txt', whether or not the file initially existed. It will be created if necessary, and if it already exists – it will be overwritten.\n\nLearn more from the following resources:",

The super user can be accessed through the `sudo` or `su` commands.\n\nSpecifically, `su` switches the current user to the root, whereas `sudo` allows you to run a command as another user, default being root. However, they also have a key difference which is `sudo` will log the commands and its arguments which can be a handy audit trail.\n\n    # This would prompt for root password and switch you to root usermode\n    $ su -\n    \n    # To perform a command as superuser (if allowed in sudoers list)\n    $ sudo <command>\n    \n\nNote that super user privileges should be handled with care due to their potential to disrupt the system's functionality.

STDOUT handles normal command output while STDERR specifically handles error messages. You can redirect these streams using operators like `>` for stdout and `2>` for stderr, allowing separate handling of normal output and errors for better scripting and debugging.\n\nHere is an example code snippet showing how these channels are used:\n\n    $ command > stdout.txt 2>stderr.txt\n    \n\nIn this example, the \">\" operator redirects the standard output (stdout) into a text file named stdout.txt, while \"2>\" redirects the standard error (stderr) into stderr.txt.

Use `dmesg` to view kernel ring buffer messages in real-time, or access logs in `/var/log`. Systemd uses `journalctl` for logging. Log levels range from emergency (system unusable) to debug messages.\n\nThe \"logs under booting\" in Linux refers to the messages and information that are generated during the boot process. These logs record all operations and events that take place while the system is booting, which might assist in diagnosing a system issue or understanding system behavior.\n\nLinux utilizes various log message levels from `emerg` (the system is unusable) to `debug` (debug-level messages). During the boot process, messages from various components of the system like kernel, init, services, etc., are stored. Many Linux distributions use systemd logging system, `journalctl`, which holds the logs of the boot process.\n\nViewing boot messages can occur in real-time with the `dmesg` command. It's used to read and print the kernel ring buffer. Or they can be accessed via the logging setup of your system, which often includes text files in `/var/log`.\n\n    dmesg | less\n    \n\nThis command presents the boot logs in a less direct format with the ability to scroll up and down. The kernel ring buffer only has a certain size, so old messages will be discarded after some time.",
