    "description": "Rust is a system programming language that aims to provide memory safety, concurrency, and performance with a focus on zero cost abstractions. It was originally created by Graydon Hoare at Mozilla Research, with contributions from Brendan Eich, the creator of JavaScript. Rust is appreciated for the solutions it provides to common programming language issues. Its emphasis on safety, speed, and support for concurrent programming, as well as its robust type system, are just a few reasons why developers choose Rust.",

    "description": "To install Rust, navigate to the official website at [https://www.rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org) and download the appropriate installation file (or run the appropriate terminal command) for your operating system. You'll be installing `rustup`, which is the preferred tool for installing, updating, and managing your core Rust tooling. For UNIX systems like Linux and MacOS, installation is as easy as running a single command in the terminal. For Windows, you'll be provided with an '.exe' installer which you need to execute. Further instructions can be found on the download page of the website.\n\nKeep in mind that for the compiler to create executables, you'll also need a linker on your operating system, such as 'GCC'. Otherwise, you'll encounter errors when you try to run `rustc` or `cargo`. This is one necessary thing that `rustup` doesn't install for you. Such linker components are part of the C standard library, so they may or may not be partially or fully preinstalled on your system. For example, a common error when running `rustc` for the first time in a 64-bit Linux environment is that your system is missing 32-bit support for GCC, which can be solved by installing `gcc-multilib`.\n\nYou can update your Rust version at any time by running `rustup update` in the terminal.",

The `if` and `else` structures are used to execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions. Similar to other languages, `while` and `for` are used for looping over a block of code. The `while` loop repeats a block of code until the condition is false, and the `for` loop is used to iterate over a collection of values, such as an array or a range. The `loop` keyword tells Rust to execute a block of code over and over again forever or until you explicitly tell it to stop. Rust's `match` structure, which is similar to switch statements in other languages, is a powerful tool used for pattern matching: it checks through different cases defined by the programmer and executes the block where the match is found. The `if let` syntax lets you combine `if` and `let` into a less verbose way to handle values that match one pattern while ignoring the rest.\n\nLearn more from the following links:",

    "title": "Functions and Method Syntax",
    "description": "In Rust, functions are declared using the `fn` keyword. Each function can take a set of input variables with their specified types, and may return data of a specified type. The body of a function is contained within curly braces `{}`. Unlike other languages, in Rust, you don't need to end the last statement in a block with a semicolon; omitting the last semicolon of a block in this way turns the last statement into an expression, and the result of this expression becomes the implicit return value of the block. In other words, if we want to return a value, we simply write the expression we want to return.\n\nAn example of a function that returns implicitly in Rust is `fn add(one: i32, two: i32) -> i32 { one + two }`, where `one` and `two` are parameters of type `i32`. This function returns an integer of type `i32`, which is the result of `one + two`. Rust also has an explicit `return` keyword to exit a function with a given value, like so: `fn add(one: i32, two: i32) -> i32 { return one + two; }`. Using a `return` statement versus the implicit return syntax is mostly a matter of preference.\n\nLearn more from the following links:",

In Rust, if something is one of a given set of possibilities (e.g., `Rock` or `Paper` or `Scissors`), it's probably appropriate to represent that data with an enum, like so: `enum RpsChoice { Rock, Paper, Scissors }`.\n\nAn instance of an `enum` can be one and only one of the enum's declared variants at any given time. Unlike enumerations in some other languages, variants in Rust are not restricted to a singular data type. When you define an `enum`, you can decide for each of its possible variants whether or not that variant will hold additional embedded data; each variant of the enum is also allowed to hold data of completely different types and amounts. You can even embed structs and other enums in a variant, making enums incredibly versatile.\n\nEnums in Rust are one way to enable simple pattern matching for a value, which allows you to compare the interior structure of a value to a series of patterns using a `match` block. For example, you can execute different branches of code based on whether an `RpsChoice` value is `Rock`, `Paper`, or `Scissors` without a verbose tree of `if`/`else` blocks. You can also handle whatever data might be embedded within that instance of the enum variant, as you will do frequently with Rust's standard `Option<T>` and `Result<T, E>` enums.\n\nLearn more from the following links:",

However, we can define pointers of trait types, and these can hold any data type that implements the `trait`. A `trait` is **implemented** for something else with the syntax `impl TraitAbc for Xyz {...}`, which can be a concrete type or another trait.\n\nYou should read carefully about traits in Rust and understand how some common traits, like `Copy`, are already implemented for various primitive types and how this could affect your program.\n\nLearn more from the following links:",
