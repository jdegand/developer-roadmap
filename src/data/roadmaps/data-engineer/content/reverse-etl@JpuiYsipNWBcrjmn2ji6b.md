# Reverse ETL

Reverse ETL is the process of extracting data from a data warehouse, transforming it to fit the requirements of operational systems, and then loading it into those other systems. This approach contrasts with traditional ETL, where data is extracted from operational systems, transformed, and loaded into a data warehouse.

While ETL and ELT focus on centralizing data, Reverse ETL aims to operationalize this data by making it actionable within third-party systems such as CRMs, marketing platforms, and other operational tools.
